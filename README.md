# Building a Spam filter with Naive Bayes

- In this project, we built a Spam filter for SMS messages.
- Our main public was telephone provider companies.
- Our main goal was to achieve the best accuracy possible using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. After testing three ways of classification (building the function with the parameters; using the scikit-learn library with similar parameters of the first try; and using different parameters of the MultinomialNB package), we got one using the scikit-learn library that reaches 98.77% of accuracy, a high number.
